Camel DSL for Akka Streams
--------------------------

[Apache Camel endpoints](http://camel.apache.org/components.html) can be integrated into [Akka Stream](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/stream/index.html) applications with a [Scala DSL](#scala-dsl) or [Java DSL](#java-dsl).

### Dependencies

The DSL is provided by the `streamz-camel-akka` artifact which is available for Scala 2.11 and 2.12:

    resolvers += "krasserm at bintray" at "http://dl.bintray.com/krasserm/maven"

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.krasserm" %% "streamz-camel-akka" % "0.10-M1"

### Configuration

The consumer receive timeout on Camel endpoints defaults to 500 ms. If you need to change that, you can do so in `application.conf`:

    streamz.camel.consumer.receive.timeout = 10s

<a name="scala-dsl"></a>
### Scala DSL

The Scala DSL can be imported with:

```scala
import streamz.camel.akka.scaladsl._
```

Its usage requires an implicit [`StreamContext`](http://krasserm.github.io/streamz/scala-2.12/unidoc/streamz/camel/StreamContext.html) in scope. A `StreamContext` uses a `CamelContext` to manage the endpoints that are created and referenced by an application. A `StreamContext` with an internally managed `CamelContext` can be created with `StreamContext()`:

```scala
import streamz.camel.StreamContext

// contains an internally managed CamelContext 
implicit val streamContext: StreamContext = StreamContext()
```

Applications that want to re-use an existing, externally managed `CamelContext` should create a `StreamContext` with  `StreamContext(camelContext: CamelContext)`: 

```scala
import org.apache.camel.CamelContext
import streamz.camel.StreamContext

// an externally managed CamelContext
val camelContext: CamelContext = ...

// re-uses the externally managed CamelContext
implicit val streamContext: StreamContext = StreamContext(camelContext)
```

A `StreamContext` internally manages an `executorService` for running blocking endpoint operations. Applications can configure a custom executor service by providing an `executorServiceFactory` during `StreamContext` creation. See [API docs](http://krasserm.github.io/streamz/scala-2.12/unidoc/streamz/camel/StreamContext$.html) for details.

After usage, a `StreamContext` should be stopped with `streamContext.stop()`. 

#### Receiving in-only message exchanges from an endpoint

An Akka Stream `Source` that emits messages consumed from a Camel endpoint can be created with `receive`. Endpoints are referenced by their [endpoint URI](http://camel.apache.org/uris.html). For example,

```scala
import akka.NotUsed
import akka.stream.scaladsl._
import streamz.camel.StreamMessage

val s1: Source[StreamMessage[String], NotUsed] = receive[String]("seda:q1")
```

creates an Akka Stream `Source` that consumes messages from the [SEDA endpoint](http://camel.apache.org/seda.html) `seda:q1` and converts them to `StreamMessage[String]`s. A [`StreamMessage[A]`](http://krasserm.github.io/streamz/scala-2.12/unidoc/streamz/camel/StreamMessage.html) contains a message `body` of type `A` and message `headers`. Calling `receive` with a `String` type parameter creates an Akka Stream `Source` that converts consumed message bodies to type `String` before emitting them as `StreamMessage[String]`. Type conversion internally uses a Camel [type converter](http://camel.apache.org/type-converter.html). An Akka Stream `Source` that only emits the converted message bodies can be created with `receiveBody`:

```scala
val s1b: Source[String, NotUsed] = receiveBody[String]("seda:q1")
```

This is equivalent to `receive[String]("seda:q1").map(_.body)`. 

`receive` and `receiveBody` can only be used with endpoints that create [in-only message exchanges](http://camel.apache.org/exchange-pattern.html). 

#### Receiving in-out message exchanges from an endpoint

An Akka Stream `Flow` whose output is received as request messages from a Camel endpoint and whose input is sent as reply messages to that endpoint can be created with `receiveRequest`. For example, 

```scala
import akka.NotUsed
import akka.stream.scaladsl._
import streamz.camel.StreamMessage

val rf1: Flow[StreamMessage[String], StreamMessage[String], NotUsed] =
  receiveRequest[String, String]("netty4:tcp://localhost:5150?textline=true")
```

creates an Akka Stream `Flow` whose output is received as request text lines from a [Netty endpoint](http://camel.apache.org/netty4.html) and whose input is sent as reply text lines to that endpoint. The created `Flow` expects reply messages to be in the same order as their corresponding request messages. Calling `receiveRequest` with `String` as second type parameter creates an Akka Stream `Flow` that converts request message bodies to type `String`, using a Camel [type converter](http://camel.apache.org/type-converter.html), before emitting them as `StreamMessage[String]`. An Akka Stream `Flow` whose output and input messages are `StreamMessage` bodies can be created with `receiveRequestBody`:

```scala
val rf1b: Flow[String, String, NotUsed] =
  receiveRequestBody[String, String]("netty4:tcp://localhost:5150?textline=true")
```

`receiveRequest` and `receiveRequestBody` can only be used with endpoints that create [in-out message exchanges](http://camel.apache.org/exchange-pattern.html). 

For creating a TCP service that prepends `hello` to request messages before replying to the sender we need to map the request messages bodies and pipe the results to the flow's input with `reply`. 

```scala
val greet: RunnableGraph[NotUsed] = rf1b.map(s => s"hello $s").reply
```

`reply` is part of the DSL and is equivalent to `join(Flow[String])` in this case. A runnable version of the example is in [Greeter.scala](https://github.com/krasserm/streamz/blob/master/streamz-examples/src/main/scala/streamz/examples/camel/akka/Greeter.scala) which can be tested with `telnet localhost 5150`.

#### Sending in-only message exchanges to an endpoint
     
For sending a `StreamMessage` to a Camel endpoint, the `send` combinator should be used:

```scala
val s2: Source[StreamMessage[String], NotUsed] = s1.send("seda:q2‚Äù, parallelism = 3)
```

This initiates an in-only message [exchange](http://camel.apache.org/exchange.html) with an endpoint and continues the stream with the sent `StreamMessage`. The optional `parallelism` parameter determines how many sends can be executed in parallel and defaults to 1. For values greater than 1 the message order is still preserved by `send`.

The `send` combinator is not only available for sources of type `Source[StreamMessage[A], M]` but more generally for any source of type `Source[A, M]`:

```scala
val s2b: Source[String, NotUsed] = s1b.send("seda:q2")
```

If `A` is not a `StreamMessage`, `send` automatically wraps the message as message body into a `StreamMessage[A]` before sending it to the endpoint and continues the stream with the unwrapped `A`. The `send` combinator is also available for flows of type 

- `Flow[A, B, M]`
- `SubFlow[A, M, Source[A, M]#Repr, Source[A, M]#Closed]` and 
- `SubFlow[B, M, Flow[A, B, M]#Repr, Flow[A, B, M]#Closed]`

Instead of using the implicit `send` and `sendBody` combinators, applications can also use the `scaladsl.send` and `scaladsl.sendBody` graph stages 

```scala
package object scaladsl {
  // ...

  def send[A](uri: String, parallelism: Int = 1)(implicit context: StreamContext): 
    Graph[FlowShape[StreamMessage[A], StreamMessage[A]], NotUsed]

  def sendBody[A](uri: String, parallelism: Int = 1)(implicit context: StreamContext): 
    Graph[FlowShape[A, A], NotUsed]

  // ...
}
```

together with the Akka Streams `via` combinator:


```scala
val s2: Source[StreamMessage[String], NotUsed] = s1.via(send("seda:q2"))
val s2b: Source[String, NotUsed] = s1b.via(sendBody("seda:q2"))
```

#### Sending in-out message exchanges to an endpoint

For sending a request `StreamMessage` to an endpoint and obtaining a reply, the `sendRequest` combinator should be used:

```scala
val s3: Source[StreamMessage[Int], NotUsed] = s2.sendRequest[Int]("bean:service?method=weight", parallelism = 3)
```

This initiates an in-out message exchange with the endpoint and continues the stream with the output `StreamMessage`. Here, a [Bean endpoint](https://camel.apache.org/bean.html) is used to call the `weight(String): Int` method on an object that is registered in the `CamelContext` under the name `service`. The input message body is used as `weight` call argument, the output message body is assigned the return value. The `sendRequest` type parameter `[Int]` specifies the expected output value type. The output message body can also be converted to another type provided that an appropriate Camel type converter is available, (`Double`, for example). The optional `parallelism` parameter determines how many requests can be executed in parallel and defaults to 1. For values greater than 1 the message order is still preserved by `sendRequest`.

The `sendRequest` combinator is not only available for sources of type `Source[StreamMessage[A], M]` but more generally for any source of type `Source[A, M]`:

```scala
val s3b: Source[Int, NotUsed] = s2b.sendRequest[Int]("bean:service?method=weight")
```

If `A` is not a `StreamMessage`, `sendRequest` automatically wraps the message as message body into a `StreamMessage[A]` before sending it to the endpoint and continues the stream with the unwrapped message body `B` of the output `StreamMessage[B]`. The `sendRequest` combinator is also available for flows of type 

- `Flow[A, B, M]`
- `SubFlow[A, M, Source[A, M]#Repr, Source[A, M]#Closed]` and 
- `SubFlow[B, M, Flow[A, B, M]#Repr, Flow[A, B, M]#Closed]`

Instead of using the implicit `sendRequest` and `sendRequestBody` combinators, applications can also use the `scaladsl.sendRequest` and `scaladsl.sendRequestBody` graph stages 

```scala
package object scaladsl {
  // ...

  def sendRequest[A, B](uri: String, parallelism: Int = 1)(implicit context: StreamContext, tag: ClassTag[B]): 
    Graph[FlowShape[StreamMessage[A], StreamMessage[B]], NotUsed]

  def sendRequestBody[A, B](uri: String, parallelism: Int = 1)(implicit context: StreamContext, tag: ClassTag[B]): 
    Graph[FlowShape[A, B], NotUsed]

  // ...
}
```

together with the Akka Streams `via` combinator:

```scala
val s3: Source[StreamMessage[Int], NotUsed] = s2.via(sendRequest[String, Int]("bean:service?method=weight"))
val s3b: Source[Int, NotUsed] = s2b.via(sendRequestBody[String, Int]("bean:service?method=weight"))
```

### Java DSL

The Java DSL can be accessed by implementing the `JavaDsl` interface:

```java
import streamz.camel.StreamContext;
import streamz.camel.akka.javadsl.JavaDsl;

public class Example implements JavaDsl {
    private StreamContext streamContext;

    public Example(StreamContext streamContext) {
        this.streamContext = streamContext;
    }

    @Override
    public StreamContext streamContext() {
        return streamContext;
    }

    // ...
}
```

An implementation class must implement the `streamContext` method and return the [`StreamContext`](http://krasserm.github.io/streamz/scala-2.12/unidoc/streamz/camel/StreamContext.html) that is used by an application. A `StreamContext` uses a `CamelContext` to manage the endpoints that are created and referenced by an application. A `StreamContext` instance can (and usually should) be shared by several `JavaDsl` instances. A `StreamContext` with an internally managed `CamelContext` can be created with `StreamContext.create()`:

```java
// contains an internally managed CamelContext 
StreamContext streamContext = StreamContext.create();
```

Applications that want to re-use an existing, externally managed `CamelContext` should create a `StreamContext` with  `StreamContext.create(CamelContext camelContext)`:

```java
import org.apache.camel.CamelContext;

// an externally managed CamelContext
CamelContext camelContext = ...

// re-uses the externally managed CamelContext
StreamContext streamContext = StreamContext.create(camelContext);
```

A `StreamContext` internally manages an `executorService` for running blocking endpoint operations. Applications can configure a custom executor service by providing an `executorServiceFactory` during `StreamContext` creation. See [API docs](http://krasserm.github.io/streamz/scala-2.12/unidoc/streamz/camel/StreamContext$.html) for details.

After usage, a `StreamContext` should be stopped with `streamContext.stop()`. 

#### Receiving in-only message exchanges from an endpoint

An Akka Stream `Source` that emits messages consumed from a Camel endpoint can be created with `receive`. Endpoints are referenced by their [endpoint URI](http://camel.apache.org/uris.html). For example,

```java
import akka.NotUsed;
import akka.stream.javadsl.Source;
import streamz.camel.StreamMessage;

Source<StreamMessage<String>, NotUsed> s1 = receive("seda:q1", String.class);
```

creates an Akka Stream `Source` that consumes messages from the [SEDA endpoint](http://camel.apache.org/seda.html) `seda:q1` and converts them to `StreamMessage[String]`s. A [`StreamMessage<A>`](http://krasserm.github.io/streamz/scala-2.12/unidoc/streamz/camel/StreamMessage.html) contains a message body of type `A` and message headers that can be accessed with `getBody()` and `getHeaders()`, respectively. Calling `receive` with a `String.class` parameter creates an Akka Stream `Source` that converts consumed message bodies to type `String` before emitting them as `StreamMessage[String]`. Type conversion internally uses a Camel [type converter](http://camel.apache.org/type-converter.html). An Akka Stream `Source` that only emits the converted message bodies can be created with `receiveBody`:

```java
Source<String, NotUsed> s1b = receiveBody("seda:q1", String.class);
```

This is equivalent to `receive("seda:q1", String.class).map(StreamMessage::getBody);`.

`receive` and `receiveBody` can only be used with endpoints that create [in-only message exchanges](http://camel.apache.org/exchange-pattern.html). 

#### Receiving in-out message exchanges from an endpoint

An Akka Stream `Flow` whose output is received as request messages from a Camel endpoint and whose input is sent as reply messages to that endpoint can be created with `receiveRequest`. For example, 

```java
import akka.NotUsed;
import akka.stream.javadsl.Flow;
import streamz.camel.StreamMessage;

Flow<StreamMessage<String>, StreamMessage<String>, NotUsed> rf1 =
        receiveRequest("netty4:tcp://localhost:5150?textline=true", String.class);
```

creates an Akka Stream `Flow` whose output is received as request text lines from a [Netty endpoint](http://camel.apache.org/netty4.html) and whose input is sent as reply text lines to that endpoint. The created `Flow` expects reply messages to be in the same order as their corresponding request messages. Calling `receiveRequest` with `String.class` parameter creates an Akka Stream `Flow` that converts request message bodies to type `String`, using a Camel [type converter](http://camel.apache.org/type-converter.html), before emitting them as `StreamMessage<String>`. An Akka Stream `Flow` whose output and input messages are `StreamMessage` bodies can be created with `receiveRequestBody`:

```java
Flow<String, String, NotUsed> rf1b =
        receiveRequestBody("netty4:tcp://localhost:5150?textline=true", String.class);
```

`receiveRequest` and `receiveRequestBody` can only be used with endpoints that create [in-out message exchanges](http://camel.apache.org/exchange-pattern.html). 

For creating a TCP service that prepends `hello` to request messages before replying to the sender we need to map the request messages bodies and pipe the results to the flow's input with `join(reply())`. 

```java
RunnableGraph<NotUsed> greet = rf1b.map(line -> "hello " + line).join(reply());
```

`reply()` is part of the DSL and is equivalent to `Flow.create()`. A runnable version of the example is in [JGreeter.java](https://github.com/krasserm/streamz/blob/master/streamz-examples/src/main/java/streamz/examples/camel/akka/JGreeter.java) which can be tested with `telnet localhost 5150`.

#### Sending in-only message exchanges to an endpoint

For sending a `StreamMessage` to a Camel endpoint, one of the `send` graph stages should be used

```java
public interface JavaDsl {
    default <A> Graph<FlowShape<StreamMessage<A>, StreamMessage<A>>, NotUsed> send(String uri, int parallelism) { /* ... */ };
    default <A> Graph<FlowShape<StreamMessage<A>, StreamMessage<A>>, NotUsed> send(String uri) { /* ... */ };
}
```

together with the Akka Streams `via` combinator:

```java
Source<StreamMessage<String>, NotUsed> s2 = s1.via(send("seda:q2", 3));
```

This initiates an in-only message [exchange](http://camel.apache.org/exchange.html) with an endpoint and continues the stream with the sent `StreamMessage`. The optional `parallelism` parameter determines how many sends can be executed in parallel and defaults to 1. For values greater than 1 the message order is still preserved by `send`.

To create a graph stage that processes messages of type other than `StreamMessage[A]`, one of the `sendBody` methods should be used:

```java
public interface JavaDsl {
    default <A> Graph<FlowShape<A, A>, NotUsed> sendBody(String uri, int parallelism) { /* ... */ };
    default <A> Graph<FlowShape<A, A>, NotUsed> sendBody(String uri) { /* ... */ };
}
```

`sendBody` wraps a message of type `A` as message body into a `StreamMessage[A]` before sending it to the endpoint and continues the stream with the unwrapped `A`:

```java
Source<String, NotUsed> s2b = s1b.via(sendBody("seda:q2"));
```

#### Sending in-out message exchanges to an endpoint

For sending a request `StreamMessage` to an endpoint and obtaining a reply, one of the `sendRequest` graph stages should be used:

```java
public interface JavaDsl {
    default <A, B> Graph<FlowShape<StreamMessage<A>, StreamMessage<B>>, NotUsed> sendRequest(String uri, int parallelism, Class<B> clazz) { /* ... */ };
    default <A, B> Graph<FlowShape<StreamMessage<A>, StreamMessage<B>>, NotUsed> sendRequest(String uri, Class<B> clazz) { /* ... */ };
}
```

together with the Akka Streams `via` combinator:

```java
Source<StreamMessage<Integer>, NotUsed> s3 = s2.via(sendRequest("bean:service?method=weight", 3, Integer.class));
```

This initiates an in-out message exchange with the endpoint and continues the stream with the output `StreamMessage`. Here, a [Bean endpoint](https://camel.apache.org/bean.html) is used to call the `weight(String): Int` method on an object that is registered in the `CamelContext` under the name `service`. The input message body is used as `weight` call argument, the output message body is assigned the return value. The `clazz` parameter specifies the expected output value type. The output message body can also be converted to another type provided that an appropriate Camel type converter is available, (`Double`, for example). The optional `parallelism` parameter determines how many requests can be executed in parallel and defaults to 1. For values greater than 1 the message order is still preserved by `sendRequest`.

To create a graph stage that processes messages of type other than `StreamMessage[A]`, one of the `sendRequestBody` methods should be used:

```java
public interface JavaDsl {
    default <A, B> Graph<FlowShape<A, B>, NotUsed> sendRequestBody(String uri, int parallelism, Class<B> clazz) { /* ... */ };
    default <A, B> Graph<FlowShape<A, B>, NotUsed> sendRequestBody(String uri, Class<B> clazz) { /* ... */ };
}
```

`sendBody` wraps a message of type `A` as message body into a `StreamMessage[A]` before sending it to the endpoint and continues the stream with the unwrapped message body `B` of the output `StreamMessage[B]`.
